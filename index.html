							I am research assistant in the Department of Information Technology at Georgia Southern University in Georgia, USA. I am pursuing my Masters in IT at Georgia Southern. And I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. Currently, my research revolves around various areas such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Brain Computer Interface.

							My expertise includes creating and refining Machine Learning models and pipelines using cloud platforms like Azure ML Studio, AWS Sagemaker, and Google Big Query. I am also skilled in data mining and visualization tools such as WEKA, Orange, SPSS, Rapid Miner, RStudio, Google Firebase, Power BI, and Tableau.
							
							Before enrolling in the MSIT program, I served as an IT Analyst at the well-known multinational company, Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. During this time, I worked extensively with Microsoft Azure Platform for tasks like hosting applications, migrating data from on-premises servers, and contributing to B2B marketing technology projects. I was also involved in creating a global iQ recommendation system for data preparation, analytics, and output analysis.
							
							My career aspirations lie in the realms of computer and information technology. Besides my professional pursuits, I enjoy reading fiction novels during my leisure moments as it offers me an escape from any stress of life. I love watching movies on weekends and cherish spending quality time with my family.
